    "# Building an LLM Agent to Find Relevant Research Papers from Arxiv\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created by Andrei Chernov ([Github](https://github.com/ChernovAndrey), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-chernov-58b157236/))\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will create an LLM agent based on the **MistralAI** language model. The agent's primary purpose will be to find and summarize research papers from **Arxiv** that are relevant to the user's query. To build the agent, we will use the **LlamaIndex** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used by the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will utilize the following three tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG Query Engine**\n",
    "   This tool will store and retrieve recent papers from Arxiv, serving as a knowledge base for efficient and quick access to relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Paper Fetch Tool**\n",
    "   If the user specifies a topic that is not covered in the RAG Query Engine, this tool will fetch recent papers on the specified topic directly from Arxiv.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PDF Download Tool**\n",
    "   This tool allows the agent to download a research paper's PDF file locally using a link provided by Arxiv."

      "Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have enabled speech-based user interactions, significantly enhancing user experience and accelerating the deployment of LALMs in real-world applications. However, ensuring the safety of LALMs is crucial to prevent risky outputs that may raise societal concerns or violate AI regulations. Despite the importance of this issue, research on jailbreaking LALMs remains limited due to their recent emergence and the additional technical challenges they present compared to attacks on DNN-based audio models. Specifically, the audio encoders in LALMs, which involve discretization operations, often lead to gradient shattering, hindering the effectiveness of attacks relying on gradient-based optimizations. The behavioral variability of LALMs further complicates the identification of effective (adversarial) optimization targets. Moreover, enforcing stealthiness constraints on adversarial audio waveforms introduces a reduced, non-convex feasible solution space, further intensifying the challenges of the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, we develop AdvWave, the first jailbreak framework against LALMs. We propose a dual-phase optimization method that addresses gradient shattering, enabling effective end-to-end gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we develop an adaptive adversarial target search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the adversarial optimization target based on the response patterns of LALMs for specific queries. To ensure that adversarial audio remains perceptually natural to human listeners, we design a classifier-guided optimization approach that generates adversarial noise resembling common urban sounds. Extensive evaluations on multiple advanced LALMs demonstrate that AdvWave outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 40% higher average jailbreak attack success rate.\n",
