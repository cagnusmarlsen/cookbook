# Analyze your Mistral AI Models with Langfuse

## What is Langfuse?
Langfuse [(GitHub)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It includes features such as [traces](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing), [evals](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview), and [prompt management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started) to help you debug and improve your LLM app.

## Why use Tracing to gain Observability into an LLM Application?
- Capture the complete context of execution, including API calls, context, prompts, parallelism, and more
- Monitor model usage and associated costs
- Gather user feedback effectively
- Detect and identify low-quality outputs
- Create fine-tuning and testing datasets

## Langfuse and Mistral AI Integration Cookbooks
These guides offer detailed instructions for integrating Langfuse with Mistral AI using Python. By following these steps, you will learn how to effectively analyze and trace interactions with Mistral's language models, improving the transparency, debuggability, and performance monitoring of your AI-powered applications.

| Guides | Description |
|-------|-------------|
