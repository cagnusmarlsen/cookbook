        "1. User Query:\n",
        "\n",
        "The process starts when the user submits a query or request to the Python agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Code and Test Case Generation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent interprets the user's query and generates the corresponding Python code. Alongside the code, the agent creates a test case to verify the functionality of the generated code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Execution and Validation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent attempts to run the generated code to ensure it executes without errors.\n",
        "The agent then runs the test case to confirm that the code produces the correct output.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Retry Mechanism:\n",
        "\n",
        "If the code fails to run or the test case does not pass, the agent initiates a retry.\n",
        "It regenerates the code and test case, addressing any issues identified during the previous attempt.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Result Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the code runs successfully and passes the test case, the agent delivers the result to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## In summary:\n",
        "user query\n",
        "\n",
        "-> agent generate code and test case\n",
        "\n",
        "-> check if the code is runnable and the test is passed\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> if no, retry and regenerate\n",
